## Acknowledgements

These are not project contributors, but their published work fed back into
SOMTParser and deserves credit.

- **SMTStabilizer** (<https://github.com/shaowei-cai-group/SMTStabilizer>, MIT,
  © 2026 Xiang Zhang) vendors and extends SOMTParser's parser. Reviewing that
  fork surfaced several printer bugs on our side (the `bv2int`/`int2bv`
  conversions printing as `UNKNOWN_KIND`, the regex sort printing as
  `(RegEx String)` instead of `RegLan`, and the datatype tester printing in the
  legacy `(is-C x)` form), and its implementations of the tuple theory,
  `((_ update <selector>) t v)`, the SMT-LIB 2.7 `ubv_to_int`/`sbv_to_int`
  spellings and term-annotation preservation were used as the reference when
  adding those features here. The individual call sites carry inline notes.
