// kindToString() must name the operator it was given.
//
// The parser reads a symbol through oper_key_map (symbol -> kind) and the
// printer writes one through kindToString (kind -> symbol).  Nothing has ever
// checked that the two agree, and they did not: NT_STR_INDEXOF_REG printed as
// "str.indexof", which oper_key_map resolves to NT_STR_INDEXOF -- a different
// operator taking three arguments instead of two.  Any term containing
// str.indexof_re therefore dumped to a script this parser rejects.
//
// That defect is invisible to a per-operator test, because printing is correct
// in isolation for every operator someone remembered to check.  It is only
// visible as a property over the whole table, which is what this file asserts:
//
//     for every kind k whose printed name is a known operator symbol,
//     that symbol must resolve back to k.
//
// The converse direction is deliberately NOT asserted.  Aliases are a feature
// here: oper_key_map maps several spellings onto one kind (the FloatingPoint
// leniency described in CLAUDE.md, "-" for both negation and subtraction), so
// requiring symbol -> kind -> same symbol would fail on correct code.  Only the
// direction that makes a dump unreadable is a defect.
